Coffee shops have massive billboards to advertise their products and buying laundry detergents can be quite an undertaking. Choosing materials for your brand new deck can be just as challenging. Read on below for some tips on what <a href="http://www.josephketnerconstruction.com/">deck</a> materials you should consider when looking to build a modern deck on your home.

<b>Pressure Treated Wood for the Economic</b>

Pressure treated lumber is still the number one most sold lumber on the market today. The reason for this is the fact that it is economical, easy to cut and fasten, and available no matter what coast you live on. The fact that most pressure treated, also known at PT, is made from southern yellow pine and then treated with chemicals to ensure itâ€™s protection from fungus, wood-eating bugs and rot recommends it as well.

The only cons to pressure treated lumber is that it has a tendency to crack, warp, and split. It is also necessary to maintain the deck in order to prolong itâ€™s life.

<b>Redwood and Cedar for the Naturally Superior </b>

For homeowners that are purists, the only option in their eyes is either redwood or cedar. Neither of these options is treated with chemicals, making the environmentally friendly among you extra happy. These options also have a rich and colorful wood. The natural chemicals in this wood make them resistant to rot, decay, and certain kinds of insects.

The bad thing about redwood and cedar is that the amount of weather and bug resistance they have will be directly related to the amount of heartwood there is in the boards themselves.

<b>Tropical Hardwoods for the Exotic Minded</b>

Tropical hardwoods are extremely popular for the following reasons.
<ul>
	<li>They are exotic</li>
	<li>Have rich grains</li>
	<li>Extremely hard wood</li>
	<li>Very durable</li>
	<li>Naturally resistant to rot and insects</li>
</ul>
The cons of building a deck with tropical hardwoods are listed below as well.
<ul>
	<li>Expensive when compared to other types of lumber, such as PT</li>
	<li>Dense and heavy</li>
	<li>Hard to cut and drill</li>
	<li>So dense that they donâ€™t accept stains well</li>
</ul>
<b>Aluminum as a Stay Cool Option </b>

While not a common choice, aluminum is used for deck building by some. Aluminum decking will not rot, warp, splinter, or crack. It is also highly weather resistant and bug resistant as well. It also stays cooler in the sun and doesnâ€™t attract bugs or catch on fire.

That makes aluminum decking a pretty good option if you think about it. The only drawback is that aluminum is a lot more expensive than any of the other options discussed here today, so you might need to check your budget before making any type of a decision.

These are just a few of the deck materials that you can consider when looking to add a deck onto your home. From aluminum to natural cedar or redwood, there are many options out there; you just need to choose the one that best meets your needs.
